### About Sportfolio

Sportfolio is a personal passion project, I work on when I have time. The app aims to maintain and track grass roots rugby current and historical data.
As well as this it aims to provide a platform for clubs and players, to connect, record and track stats, record and watch games.
A large part of the app, allows user to view all past and present historical data, comparing and filtering this data as they please.
Things such as, games played for club / team / lifetime, and comparing this to fellow club / team / union members; as well as viewing and comparing game, season and lifetime stats
for individuals, teams, clubs and unions. It aims to be the one stop shop for all rugby enthusiats.
